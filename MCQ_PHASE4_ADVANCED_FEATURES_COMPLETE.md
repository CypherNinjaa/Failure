	test.totalPoints
);
```

## 📝 Known Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **Prisma Client Cache**: After schema changes, may need to run `npx prisma generate` manually
2. **TypeScript Import**: PublishTestButton import may show as missing until TypeScript cache refreshes
3. **Fullscreen API**: Not supported in all browsers (fallback to regular mode)
4. **Toast Spam**: Multiple rapid actions can trigger many toasts

### Recommendations

1. Add debouncing to action buttons
2. Add loading states to all forms
3. Add error boundaries around client components
4. Add fallback for browsers without fullscreen support

---
