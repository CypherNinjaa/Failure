## 🔒 Anti-Cheating Implementation

### Frontend Detection (LIVE NOW!)

1. **Tab Switch Detection** ✅

   ```typescript
   document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", () => {
   	if (document.hidden) {
   		setTabSwitches((prev) => prev + 1);
   		toast.warning("Tab switch detected!");
   	}
   });
   ```

   - Counts every time student leaves the tab
   - Displays warning toast
   - Shows counter in header

2. **Copy-Paste Blocking** ✅

   ```typescript
   document.addEventListener("copy", preventCopyPaste);
   document.addEventListener("paste", preventCopyPaste);
   document.addEventListener("cut", preventCopyPaste);
   ```

   - Prevents all copy/paste/cut operations
   - Displays error toast
   - Counts attempts

3. **Right-Click Disabled** ✅

   ```typescript
   document.addEventListener("contextmenu", (e) => {
   	e.preventDefault();
   	toast.error("Right-click is disabled!");
   });
   ```

   - Prevents inspect element access
   - Shows error message

4. **Question Randomization** ✅

   - Shuffled server-side based on `shuffleQuestions` setting
   - Each student sees different order

5. **Option Randomization** ✅
   - Shuffled client-side based on `shuffleOptions` setting
   - Different option order per student

### Backend Tracking (LIVE NOW!)

6. **Submission with Metrics** ✅

   ```typescript
   await submitMCQAttempt({
   	testId,
   	studentId,
   	answers,
   	timeSpent,
   	tabSwitches, // Sent to server
   	copyPasteAttempts, // Sent to server
   });
   ```

7. **Auto-Flagging** ✅
   ```typescript
   isFlagged: tabSwitches > 5 || copyPasteAttempts > 3;
   ```
   - Automatically flags suspicious attempts
   - Teachers can review flagged tests

---

## 📊 Scoring System Details

### Calculation Logic:

```typescript
test.questions.forEach((question) => {
	const studentAnswer = answers[question.id];

	if (!studentAnswer) {
		unanswered++;
		// No points change
	} else if (studentAnswer === correctAnswer) {
		score += question.points; // e.g., +2
		correctAnswers++;
	} else {
		score -= question.negativeMarking; // e.g., -0.5 (max -4)
		wrongAnswers++;
		saveWrongAnswer(studentId, question.id);
	}
});

score = Math.max(0, score); // Floor at 0
percentageScore = (score / totalPoints) * 100;
```

### Example:

**Test:** 10 questions × 2 points each = 20 total points, negative marking = 0.5

**Student answers:**

- 7 correct: +14 points
- 2 wrong: -1 point
- 1 unanswered: 0 points

**Final:**

- Score: 13 / 20
- Percentage: 65%
- Passed: No (passing score: 70%)

5. ✅ **Next.js Image optimization**

   - Changed `<img>` → `<Image>` with width/height

6. ✅ **Apostrophe escaping**

---

## 🚦 How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Login as Admin/Teacher

- Navigate to `/list/mcq-tests`
- Click "+" to create a test
- Fill in all details and create
- Update the test to add questions (or use API for now)

### 3. Login as Student

- Navigate to `/list/mcq-tests`
- See the published test
- Click "Start Test"
- Answer questions
- Observe anti-cheat warnings if you:
  - Switch tabs
  - Try to copy-paste
  - Right-click
- Submit the test
- View results with confetti (if passed!)

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

### State Management Consideration:

The current test-taking interface uses React state, which means refreshing the page will lose progress. Consider adding:

1. localStorage backup for answers
2. Server-side draft saving (auto-save every 30 seconds)
3. "Resume Test" functionality

### Performance Optimization:

- Implement virtualization for long question lists
- Lazy load question images
- Cache leaderboard rankings (Redis)
- Optimize Prisma queries with proper indexes

### Accessibility:

- Add ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation for question grid
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management for modals

### Security Enhancements:

- Rate limiting on test submissions
- CSRF tokens for all forms
- Input sanitization for JSON fields
- Server-side validation of all inputs
