---

## 📸 Photo Requirements

For best results, student photos should be:

- 📷 **Frontal face**, looking at camera
- 💡 **Well-lit**, no shadows
- 👤 **Face clearly visible** (no sunglasses/masks)
- 📐 **At least 200x200px**
- 🎯 **Recent** (within last 2 years)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Models not loading

**Fix**: Check `public/models/` has all 8 files

### Issue: Face not detected

**Fix**:

- Improve lighting
- Face camera directly
- Check student has uploaded photo
