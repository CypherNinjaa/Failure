## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Ensure Students Have Photos

Students must have profile pictures uploaded via the Student form (stored in Cloudinary).

### Step 2: Access Face Recognition

1. Go to **Classes** (`/list/classes`)
2. Click the **purple camera icon** 🎥 next to any class
3. Or manually navigate to `/list/classes/[classId]/face-attendance`

### Step 3: Take Attendance

1. Click **"Start Camera"** button
2. Grant camera permissions if prompted
3. Have students face the camera one by one
4. Detected students appear with green boxes and names
5. Click **"Submit Attendance"** when done

## 📊 Features

- 📊 Progress counter
- 📋 Live detected students list

### Smart Attendance

- ✅ Marks detected students as **Present**
- ✅ Marks undetected students as **Absent**
- ✅ Updates existing records (no duplicates)
- ✅ Normalizes dates to start of day

## 🎯 Modified Files

1. **`src/lib/actions.ts`**

   - Added `createFaceRecognitionAttendance` function

2. **`src/app/(dashboard)/list/classes/page.tsx`**
   - Added purple camera icon button
   - Added link to face recognition page

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Face Matching Threshold

Located in `FaceRecognitionAttendance.tsx` line ~100:

```typescript
const matcher = new faceapi.FaceMatcher(labeledDescriptors, 0.6);
```

- **0.6** = Default (balanced)
- **Lower** (0.4) = Stricter matching (fewer false positives)
- **Higher** (0.8) = Looser matching (may have false positives)

### Detection Frequency

Located in `FaceRecognitionAttendance.tsx` line ~207:

```typescript
setInterval(() => {
	detectFaces();
}, 1000); // 1000ms = 1 second
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Models not loading

**Solution**: Ensure all 8 model files are in `public/models/`

```bash
ls public/models/
# Should show 8 files
```

### Issue: Face not detected

**Solutions**:

- Improve lighting
- Face camera directly
- Remove glasses/mask
- Ensure student photo is clear frontal face

### Issue: Wrong student identified

**Solutions**:

- Lower threshold (stricter matching)
- Use higher quality student photos
- Ensure unique facial features visible

### Issue: Camera permission denied

**Solutions**:

- Grant permissions in browser settings
- Try different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
- Check system privacy settings

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ All face matching happens **client-side** (privacy-friendly)
- ✅ No face data sent to external servers
- ✅ Role-based access control enforced
- ✅ Attendance data stored securely in database

## 📈 Performance

- **Model Loading**: ~2-3 seconds (one-time)
- **Face Detection**: ~100-200ms per frame
- **Face Recognition**: ~50-100ms per face
- **Memory Usage**: ~150MB (models + processing)

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Optimal Results:

1. ✅ Use clear, frontal student photos
2. ✅ Ensure good lighting in classroom
3. ✅ Have students face camera directly
4. ✅ Process one student at a time for best accuracy
5. ✅ Update photos if students change appearance significantly

### Photo Requirements:

- 📸 Frontal face, looking at camera
- 💡 Well-lit, no shadows
- 👤 Face clearly visible
- 🎯 No heavy accessories (optional)
- 📐 Minimum 200x200px recommended
