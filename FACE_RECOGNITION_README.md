## 📸 Tips for Best Results

### Lighting & Environment

- ✅ Ensure room is **well-lit**
- ✅ Avoid backlighting (windows behind students)
- ✅ Use consistent lighting conditions

### Camera Positioning

- ✅ Place camera at **eye level**
- ✅ Distance: **2-5 feet** from student's face
- ✅ Clear, unobstructed view

### Student Positioning

- ✅ Face the camera **directly** (frontal view)
- ✅ Look straight at the camera
- ✅ Remove glasses if recognition fails
- ✅ One student at a time works best

### Photo Quality

- ✅ Student profile photos should be:
  - **Clear and recent**
  - **Frontal face** (not profile/side view)
  - **Good resolution** (not blurry)
  - **Similar lighting** to classroom conditions

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture

```
Student Photos (Cloudinary)
    ↓
Face-API.js Models (Public/Models)
    ↓
Browser Webcam → Face Detection → Face Matching
    ↓
Attendance API → PostgreSQL Database
```

### Components

- **FaceRecognitionAttendance.tsx** - Main face recognition component
- **FaceRecognitionAttendanceClient.tsx** - Client wrapper
- **/api/face-attendance** - API endpoint for saving attendance
- **createFaceRecognitionAttendance** - Server action

### Models Used

1. **SSD MobileNet V1** - Fast face detection (~5-10ms per frame)
2. **Face Landmark 68** - 68-point facial landmark detection
3. **Face Recognition Net** - 128-dimensional face descriptors

### Performance

- Detection runs every **1 second** (configurable)
- Models cached after first load
- Typical recognition time: **100-300ms per face**
- Supports multiple faces (sequential processing recommended)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Models Not Loading

**Problem:** Loading screen stuck or error message  
**Solution:**

- Verify all 8 model files are in `public/models/`
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Ensure Next.js server is running

### Camera Not Working

**Problem:** "Failed to access camera" error  
**Solution:**

- Grant camera permissions in browser
- Check browser settings → Privacy → Camera
- Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Ensure no other app is using camera

### Face Not Detected

**Problem:** No bounding box appears around face  
**Solution:**

- Improve lighting conditions
- Move closer to camera (2-3 feet)
- Face camera directly (not at angle)
- Remove glasses or hats
- Ensure face is clearly visible

### Wrong Student Identified

**Problem:** System recognizes wrong student  
**Solution:**

- Check student profile photo quality
- Ensure photo is recent and clear
- Adjust matching threshold in code (default: 0.6)
  - Lower threshold = more strict matching
  - Higher threshold = more lenient matching
- Update student photo with better quality image

### No Student Photos

**Problem:** "No faces could be loaded" error  
**Solution:**

- Ensure students have profile photos uploaded
- Photos must be uploaded via Student form
- Photos stored in Cloudinary
- Check student records in database

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### Attendance Table

```typescript
{
  id: number (auto-increment)
  studentId: string (Clerk user ID)
  date: DateTime (normalized to start of day)
  present: boolean (true if detected, false if not)
  lessonId: number? (optional)
}
```

### Unique Constraint

- `@@unique([studentId, date])` - Prevents duplicate records
- Updates existing record if attendance already taken for that date

---

## 🔐 Security & Access Control

### Route Protection

- `/list/classes/[id]/face-attendance` - Protected route
- Only accessible to teachers and admins
- Middleware enforces role checking

### API Security

- POST `/api/face-attendance` - Requires authentication
- Role validation: teacher or admin only
- CSRF protection enabled

### Privacy Considerations

- All face processing happens **client-side**
- No face images sent to server
- Only student IDs submitted to API
- Camera access requires explicit user permission

---

## 🚀 Advanced Configuration

### Adjusting Match Threshold

Edit `src/components/FaceRecognitionAttendance.tsx`:

```typescript
// Line ~100
const matcher = new faceapi.FaceMatcher(labeledDescriptors, 0.6);
//                                                          ↑
//                                            Change this value
// Lower = stricter (0.4-0.5)
// Higher = more lenient (0.7-0.8)
```

### Detection Frequency

Edit `src/components/FaceRecognitionAttendance.tsx`:

```typescript
// Line ~200
const interval = setInterval(() => {
	detectFaces();
}, 1000); // ← Change interval (milliseconds)
```

### Multiple Face Detection

The system supports detecting multiple faces simultaneously, but best results are achieved with one student at a time.
