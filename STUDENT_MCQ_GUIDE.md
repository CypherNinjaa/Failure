## Navigation Integration

### Desktop Menu

- MCQ Tests link added to sidebar
- Visible to students only
- Located with other student features

### Mobile Bottom Navigation

- MCQ Tests added to main navigation bar
- Also available in "More" menu as "My MCQ Tests"
- Uses exam icon for consistency

---

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

Uses the existing MCQ schema with proper field names:

- `MCQAttempt.completedAt` (nullable Date) - Used instead of `completed` boolean
- `StudentAnswer.userAnswer` (string) - Used instead of `selectedAnswer`
- `MCQQuestion.answer` (string) - Used instead of `correctAnswer`

### Server Actions Used

1. **startMCQAttempt** - Creates new test attempt
2. **submitMCQAnswer** - Submits answer and auto-checks correctness
3. **completeMCQAttempt** - Finalizes test and calculates score

### Auto-Answer Checking

- Implemented in `submitMCQAnswer` action
- Compares student's answer with correct answer (case-insensitive, trimmed)
- Updates `correctAnswers` count in MCQAttempt
- Sets `isCorrect` flag in StudentAnswer

### Score Calculation

- Performed when test is completed via `completeMCQAttempt`
- Formula: `(correctAnswers / totalQuestions) * 100`
- Stored as decimal percentage (e.g., 85.5)

---

## User Workflow

### Taking a Test for the First Time:

1. Student navigates to `/student/mcq-tests`
2. Sees test with "Not Started" status
3. Clicks green "Start" button
4. System creates new `MCQAttempt` record
5. Redirected to `/student/mcq-tests/[id]/take`
6. Answers questions one by one
7. Gets instant feedback after each submission
8. Clicks "Finish Test" on last question
9. Redirected to `/student/mcq-tests/[id]/results`
10. Views detailed results and statistics

### Resuming an Incomplete Test:

1. Student sees test with "In Progress" status
2. Clicks yellow "Resume" button
3. Loads existing attempt with progress preserved
4. Previously answered questions show feedback
5. Can review or continue from where they left off

### Retaking a Test:

1. From results page, clicks "Take Test Again"
2. System creates new attempt
3. Previous attempts remain in history
4. Can compare performance across attempts

---

## Theme Consistency

All student pages follow the existing theme:

- **lamaPurple** - Primary actions, current selections
- **lamaSky** - Information panels, explanations
- **lamaYellow** - In-progress status
- **Green** - Success/correct answers
- **Red** - Errors/incorrect answers
- No emojis used (as per requirements)
- Consistent button styling with rest of application

---

## Access Control

### Route Protection:

- All student MCQ routes under `/student/mcq-tests`
- Middleware enforces student role access
- Teachers/admins have separate routes (`/list/mcq-tests`)

### Data Filtering:

- Students only see tests assigned to their class
- Students only see their own attempts and answers
- Cannot access other students' results
- Cannot modify test content

---

## Components Created

### Server Components:

1. `src/app/(dashboard)/student/mcq-tests/page.tsx` - Test list
2. `src/app/(dashboard)/student/mcq-tests/[id]/take/page.tsx` - Take test wrapper
3. `src/app/(dashboard)/student/mcq-tests/[id]/results/page.tsx` - Results page

### Client Components:

1. `src/components/TakeTestClient.tsx` - Interactive test-taking interface

---

## Testing Checklist

### For Teachers/Admins:

- [ ] Create a test with multiple questions
- [ ] Assign test to a class
- [ ] Add explanations to questions
- [ ] Include different question types

### For Students:
