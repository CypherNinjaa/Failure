 * Health Check Endpoint for Railway

 * Railway Healthcheck Requirements:
 * - Must return HTTP 200 status when service is ready
 * - Called from hostname: healthcheck.railway.app
 * - Default timeout: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
 * - Only called during deployment, not continuous monitoring
 *
 * Purpose: Ensures zero-downtime deployments by verifying
 * the new version is live before switching traffic
