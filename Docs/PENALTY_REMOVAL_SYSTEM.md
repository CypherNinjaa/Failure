# 🔓 Penalty Removal & Forgiveness System

## Overview

This system allows students to **reduce or completely remove penalties** earned from cheating violations through good behavior or admin intervention.

---

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Penalty Reduction** (Good Behavior Rewards)

- ✅ Students earn reduction through clean test performance
- ✅ Three eligibility criteria (any one qualifies):
  - **Option 1:** 5+ clean tests AND 30+ days without violation
  - **Option 2:** 10+ clean tests
  - **Option 3:** 60+ days without violation
- ✅ Calculates good behavior score (0-100)
- ✅ Reduces violations by up to 50% (max 2 violations removed)

### 2. **Manual Admin Forgiveness**

- ✅ **50% Reduction:** Admin can reduce penalty by half
- ✅ **Full Forgiveness:** Admin can completely clear all penalties
- ✅ Requires reason for all manual actions
- ✅ Audit trail maintained

### 3. **Automatic Suspension Expiry**

- ✅ Suspensions auto-expire after 7 days
- ✅ Runs every 6 hours via cron job
- ✅ Notifies students when suspension ends
- ✅ Updates suspension status to inactive

### 4. **Admin Dashboard**

- ✅ View all students with penalties
- ✅ Check eligibility for automatic reduction
- ✅ One-click penalty management
- ✅ Track reduction history

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Eligibility Calculation**

```typescript
// Students qualify for automatic reduction if:
const isEligible =
	(cleanTests >= 5 && daysClean >= 30) || // Good consistent behavior
	cleanTests >= 10 || // Lots of clean tests
	daysClean >= 60; // Long clean period
```

### **Good Behavior Score**

```
Score = (Clean Tests × 10, max 50) + (Days Clean × 2, max 50)
Maximum: 100 points
```

### **Example Scenarios:**

#### Scenario 1: Automatic Reduction

```
Student A:
- Total Violations: 4
- Clean Tests Since Last Violation: 6
- Days Without Violation: 35

✅ Eligible! (6 tests > 5 AND 35 days > 30)
Can Remove: 2 violations (50% of 4, max 2)
New Violation Count: 2
```

#### Scenario 2: Not Eligible Yet

```
Student B:
- Total Violations: 2
- Clean Tests Since Last Violation: 3
- Days Without Violation: 15

❌ Not Eligible
Needs: 2 more clean tests OR 15 more days
```

#### Scenario 3: Admin Full Forgiveness

```
Student C:
- Total Violations: 6
- Admin Action: Full Forgiveness
- Reason: "First-time offender, demonstrated remorse"

✅ All penalties cleared
Suspension lifted immediately
Fresh start granted
```

## 🔧 Database Schema

### Updated CheatingSuspension Model

```prisma
model CheatingSuspension {
  id             String   @id @default(cuid())
  studentId      String
  reason         String   @db.Text
  violationCount Int
  suspendedAt    DateTime @default(now())
  suspendedUntil DateTime
  isActive       Boolean  @default(true)

  // NEW: Penalty removal tracking
  wasReduced     Boolean  @default(false)
  reducedAt      DateTime?
  reducedBy      String?  // Admin ID
  reductionReason String? @db.Text
}
```

### New PenaltyReduction Model

```prisma
model PenaltyReduction {
  id                   String   @id @default(cuid())
  studentId            String
  originalSuspensionId String?
  violationsRemoved    Int      @default(0)
  reason               String   @db.Text
  reducedBy            String   // Admin ID
  reducedAt            DateTime @default(now())

  // Criteria that triggered reduction
  cleanTestsCompleted  Int      @default(0)
  daysWithoutViolation Int      @default(0)
  goodBehaviorScore    Float    @default(0)
}
```

# 7. Student receives notification
# 8. PenaltyReduction record created
```

### Test 2: Manual 50% Reduction

## 🎓 Best Practices

### When to Use Automatic Reduction

- ✅ Student has shown consistent improvement
- ✅ Multiple clean tests completed
- ✅ Significant time has passed
- ✅ Student meets clear criteria

### When to Use Manual 50% Reduction

- ✅ Student just shy of automatic criteria
- ✅ Extenuating circumstances
- ✅ First-time minor offenses
- ✅ Student demonstrated understanding

### When to Use Full Forgiveness

- ⚠️ **Use sparingly!** Full forgiveness should be rare
- ✅ Exceptional circumstances (family emergency, medical)
- ✅ False positive violations
- ✅ System error or glitch
- ✅ Student transferred from another school

### Documentation Requirements

Always provide detailed reasons:

- **Good:** "Student completed 8 clean tests over 45 days, showed genuine improvement in behavior"
- **Bad:** "Reduce penalty"

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Problem: Student eligible but reduction fails

**Check:**

1. Is student ID correct?
2. Does admin have permission?
3. Check console logs for errors
4. Verify database connection

### Problem: Suspensions not expiring

**Check:**

1. Is cron job running?
2. Check `CRON_SECRET` environment variable
3. Verify `suspendedUntil` dates in database
4. Check cron logs in Vercel dashboard

### Problem: Eligibility not updating

**Solution:**

- Click "🔄 Refresh" button
- Student must complete tests AFTER last violation
- Check `completedAt` dates in MCQAttempt table

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Console Logs to Watch

```
✅ Penalty reduced for student [id]: 2 violations removed
✅ Admin [id] fully forgave penalties for student [id]
✅ Admin [id] reduced penalties for student [id]
✅ Expired 3 old suspensions
```

### Key Metrics

```sql
-- Total penalties reduced this month
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "PenaltyReduction"
WHERE "reducedAt" >= date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE);

-- Average good behavior score for reductions
SELECT AVG("goodBehaviorScore") FROM "PenaltyReduction"
WHERE "goodBehaviorScore" > 0;

-- Most common reduction reasons
SELECT "reason", COUNT(*) as count
FROM "PenaltyReduction"
GROUP BY "reason"
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
