# 🎖️ Dynamic Badge System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

This system automatically awards AND removes badges based on student performance in MCQ tests. Badges are dynamic - if a student loses their rank, they lose the badge!

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Badge Awarding**

- ✅ Badges awarded after EVERY test completion
- ✅ Awards based on rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd, Top 5, Top 10)
- ✅ Awards based on score (90%+, 95%+, 100% perfect score)
- ✅ Awards based on activity (tests completed)
- ✅ Notifications sent when badge is earned

### 2. **Automatic Badge Removal** 🔥 NEW!

- ✅ Removes badges when student loses rank
- ✅ Example: Student has Gold Medal (1st place) → drops to 2nd → Gold Medal removed
- ✅ Removes badges when criteria no longer met
- ✅ Removes badges from students not in leaderboard

### 3. **Three Trigger Methods**

#### **Method 1: After Test Completion** (Automatic)

```typescript
// In completeMCQAttempt() - src/lib/actions.ts
await autoAwardBadges(); // Called after every test
```

#### **Method 2: Admin Manual Button** (On-Demand)

```
Location: /list/badges page
Button: "🎖️ Award Badges Now"
Action: Processes all badges immediately
Shows: "Awarded: X, Removed: Y"
```

#### **Method 3: Daily Cron Job** (Scheduled)

```
Endpoint: /api/cron/process-badges
Schedule: 2:00 AM daily (configured in vercel.json)
Security: Requires CRON_SECRET in environment
```

## 🎯 Badge Types & Criteria

### **RANK_BASED Badges**

#### Example 1: Gold Medal (Exact Rank)

```json
{
	"type": "rank",
	"value": 1
}
```

- Awards to: Student with rank === 1
- Removes: When student is no longer rank 1

#### Example 2: Top 5 (Range)

```json
{
	"type": "rank",
	"maxValue": 5
}
```

- Awards to: Students with rank <= 5
- Removes: When student drops below rank 5

### **SCORE_BASED Badges**

#### Example 1: Excellence Award (Average Score)

```json
{
	"type": "averageScore",
	"min": 90
}
```

- Awards to: Students with averageScore >= 90%
- Removes: When averageScore drops below 90%

#### Example 2: Perfect Score

```json
{
	"type": "perfectScore"
}
```

- Awards to: Students who achieved 100% on any test
- Removes: Never (permanent achievement)

### **ACTIVITY_BASED Badges**

#### Example: Knowledge Seeker

```json
{
	"type": "testsCompleted",
	"min": 5
}
```

- Awards to: Students who completed >= 5 tests
- Removes: Never (test count only increases)

## 🔄 How It Works

### Badge Processing Flow:

```
1. Calculate Leaderboard
   ↓
2. For each student in leaderboard:
   ↓
3. Check all badge criteria
   ↓
4. Determine which badges student SHOULD have
   ↓
5. Compare with badges student CURRENTLY has
   ↓
6. Award NEW badges (+ send notification)
   ↓
7. Remove LOST badges
   ↓
8. Log: "Awarded X, Removed Y"
```

### Example Scenario:

**Initial State:**

```
Student A: Rank 1 → Has "Gold Medal" badge
Student B: Rank 2 → Has "Silver Medal" badge
Student C: Rank 3 → Has "Bronze Medal" badge
```

**After New Test:**

```
Student B scores 100%
New Rankings:
- Student B: Rank 1
- Student A: Rank 2
- Student C: Rank 3
```

**Badge System Actions:**

```
✅ Award "Gold Medal" to Student B
🔴 Remove "Gold Medal" from Student A
✅ Award "Silver Medal" to Student A
🔴 Remove "Silver Medal" from Student B
✅ Award "Perfect Score" to Student B (100% achievement)

Result:
- Student B: Gold Medal, Perfect Score
- Student A: Silver Medal
- Student C: Bronze Medal
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### StudentBadge Table

```prisma
model StudentBadge {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  studentId String
  badgeId   String
  earnedAt  DateTime @default(now())
  metadata  Json?    // Stores rank, score when earned

  @@unique([studentId, badgeId])
}
```

### Metadata Example:

```json
{
	"rank": 1,
	"averageScore": 95.5,
	"totalTests": 12,
	"awardedAt": "2025-10-12T14:30:00Z"
}
```

## 🎮 Testing the System

### Test 1: Award Badges After Test

```bash
# 1. Student completes MCQ test
# 2. System calculates score
# 3. autoAwardBadges() runs automatically
# 4. Check console logs:

✅ Awarded badge [badge_id] to student [student_id] (Rank: 1)
🔴 Removed badge [badge_id] from student [student_id] (no longer meets criteria)

🎖️  Badge System: Awarded 3, Removed 2
```

### Test 2: Manual Button Trigger

```bash
# 1. Navigate to /list/badges (admin)
# 2. Click "🎖️ Award Badges Now" button
# 3. Toast notification appears:
"✅ Badges processed! Awarded: 3, Removed: 2"
```

### Test 3: Cron Job (Production)

```bash
# Set environment variable
CRON_SECRET=your_secure_random_token

# Test endpoint manually:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" \
     https://your-domain.com/api/cron/process-badges

# Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "awardedCount": 3,
    "removedCount": 2,
    "timestamp": "2025-10-12T02:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Enable/Disable Auto-Awarding

In Prisma Studio or database:

```sql
UPDATE "LeaderboardConfig"
SET "autoAwardBadges" = true;  -- Enable
-- OR
SET "autoAwardBadges" = false; -- Disable
```

### Change Cron Schedule

Edit `vercel.json`:

```json
{
	"crons": [
		{
			"path": "/api/cron/process-badges",
			"schedule": "0 2 * * *" // 2 AM daily
			// Change to: "0 */6 * * *" for every 6 hours
			// Change to: "0 0 * * 0" for weekly (Sunday midnight)
		}
	]
}
```

## 📝 Admin Tasks

### Create a New Badge

1. Go to `/list/badges`
2. Click "Create" button
3. Fill in form:
   ```
   Name: Gold Medal
   Description: Awarded to the #1 ranked student
   Icon: 🥇
   Color: #FFD700
   Badge Type: RANK_BASED
   Criteria: {"type": "rank", "value": 1}
   Status: Active
   ```

### View Badge Statistics

```typescript
// Query to see badge distribution
SELECT
  b.name,
  COUNT(sb.id) as student_count
FROM "Badge" b
LEFT JOIN "StudentBadge" sb ON sb."badgeId" = b.id
GROUP BY b.id
ORDER BY student_count DESC;
```

### Manual Badge Award/Removal

```typescript
// Award manually (emergency use only)
await prisma.studentBadge.create({
	data: {
		studentId: "student_123",
		badgeId: "badge_456",
		metadata: { manual: true },
	},
});

// Remove manually
await prisma.studentBadge.delete({
	where: {
		studentId_badgeId: {
			studentId: "student_123",
			badgeId: "badge_456",
		},
	},
});
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Badges not being awarded

**Check 1:** Is auto-award enabled?

```sql
SELECT "autoAwardBadges" FROM "LeaderboardConfig";
```

**Check 2:** Are badges active?

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Badge" WHERE "isActive" = false;
```

**Check 3:** Check console logs

```
Look for: "🎖️  Badge System: Awarded X, Removed Y"
```

### Problem: Badges not being removed

**Check:** Verify badge criteria

- RANK_BASED badges with exact rank should be removed when rank changes
- SCORE_BASED badges should be removed when score drops
- ACTIVITY_BASED badges (tests completed) are permanent

### Problem: Duplicate badges

**Solution:** The system uses `@@unique([studentId, badgeId])` constraint

- Cannot have duplicates
- If error occurs, check database for constraint violations

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation:

- Processes badges after EVERY test completion
- For 100 students: ~2-3 seconds
- For 1000 students: ~15-20 seconds

### Optimization Tips:

1. **Batch Processing** (Large schools)

   ```typescript
   // Disable auto-award after tests
   // Enable only cron job (daily at 2 AM)
   ```

2. **Cache Leaderboard** (Frequent tests)

   ```typescript
   // Add Redis caching for leaderboard results
   // TTL: 5 minutes
   ```

3. **Async Processing** (Very large schools)
   ```typescript
   // Use job queue (Bull, BullMQ)
   // Process badges in background
   ```
