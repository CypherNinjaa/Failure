# Infrastructure & Awards Dynamic System - Complete Implementation

## üéØ Overview

Successfully converted the **Infrastructure Highlights** and **Awards & Achievements** sections of the About page from static hardcoded data to a fully dynamic database-driven system with complete CMS functionality.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

This implementation follows the same architectural pattern as previous About page sections (School History, Principal Message, Leadership Team, Staff Directory).

### Database Models (6 new models)

All models include `displayOrder` and `isActive` fields for content management:

1. **Facility** - Main campus facilities with features, images, and color gradients
2. **AdditionalFeature** - Supplementary campus amenities
3. **CampusStat** - Key statistics about campus (acres, students, teachers, etc.)
4. **Award** - School awards and recognitions with categories
5. **AchievementMetric** - Key achievement metrics (pass rates, competition winners, etc.)
6. **StudentAchievement** - Specific student achievements and competition results

### CRUD Operations

**18 Server Actions** implemented in `src/lib/actions.ts`:

- `createFacility`, `updateFacility`, `deleteFacility`
- `createAdditionalFeature`, `updateAdditionalFeature`, `deleteAdditionalFeature`
- `createCampusStat`, `updateCampusStat`, `deleteCampusStat`
- `createAward`, `updateAward`, `deleteAward`
- `createAchievementMetric`, `updateAchievementMetric`, `deleteAchievementMetric`
- `createStudentAchievement`, `updateStudentAchievement`, `deleteStudentAchievement`

**Role-Based Access**: All actions restricted to `media-coordinator` and `admin` roles.

### Forms (6 new forms)

All forms use React Hook Form with Zod validation:

1. **FacilityForm** - Features as textarea (comma-separated), color gradient input, icon name, image upload
2. **AdditionalFeatureForm** - Icon name, title, description
3. **CampusStatForm** - Number/value, label, icon/emoji
4. **AwardForm** - Year, category, title, organization, description, icon name, color gradient
5. **AchievementMetricForm** - Metric value, description, detail
6. **StudentAchievementForm** - Achievement name, year, winners, icon/emoji

### Management Pages (6 new pages)

Located under `/media-coordinator/`:

- `/facilities` - Shows features count, image emoji, search by title/description
- `/additional-features` - Simple list with icon, title, description
- `/campus-stats` - Shows number prominently, search by label/number
- `/awards` - Filter by year/category, shows organization, search by title/organization/category
- `/achievement-metrics` - Displays metric prominently, search by description/metric
- `/student-achievements` - Filter by year, shows winners badge, search by name/winners

All pages include:

- Full CRUD operations via FormModal
- Search functionality
- Pagination (10 items per page)
- Display order management
- Active/Inactive toggle

## üìÅ File Changes

### Database & Schema

**prisma/schema.prisma**

```prisma
// Added 6 new models with relationships, indexes, and timestamps
model Facility { ... }
model AdditionalFeature { ... }
model CampusStat { ... }
model Award { ... }
model AchievementMetric { ... }
model StudentAchievement { ... }
```

**Migration**: `20251023023735_add_infrastructure_awards_models`

### Validation

**src/lib/formValidationSchemas.ts**

- Added 6 Zod schemas for form validation
- `facilitySchema` includes features as comma-separated string that gets parsed to array
- All schemas include `displayOrder` and `isActive` fields

### Server Actions

**src/lib/actions.ts**

- Added 18 new server actions (3 per model)
- Role-based authorization for media-coordinator and admin
- Revalidates `/about` and respective management pages after mutations
- Special handling: `facilitySchema` parses comma-separated features string to array for database

### Forms

**src/components/forms/** (6 new files)

- `FacilityForm.tsx`
- `AdditionalFeatureForm.tsx`
- `CampusStatForm.tsx`
- `AwardForm.tsx`
- `AchievementMetricForm.tsx`
- `StudentAchievementForm.tsx`

All forms use:

- React Hook Form with Zod resolver
- `useFormState` for server action integration
- Progressive enhancement
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback

### Management Pages

**src/app/(dashboard)/media-coordinator/** (6 new directories)

- `facilities/page.tsx`
- `additional-features/page.tsx`
- `campus-stats/page.tsx`
- `awards/page.tsx`
- `achievement-metrics/page.tsx`
- `student-achievements/page.tsx`

Each page includes:

- Data fetching with Prisma
- Search and filter functionality
- Pagination
- Table display with `Table` component
- FormModal integration for CRUD operations

### Form Integration

**src/components/FormContainer.tsx**

- Updated type union to include 6 new table types:
  ```typescript
  "facility" |
  	"additionalFeature" |
  	"campusStat" |
  	"award" |
  	"achievementMetric" |
  	"studentAchievement";
  ```

**src/components/FormModal.tsx**

- Imported all 6 delete actions
- Added to `deleteActionMap` object
- Added 6 dynamic imports with lazy loading
- Added 6 entries to `forms` object

### Navigation

**src/components/Menu.tsx** (Desktop)

- Added 6 new menu items under MEDIA section
- All visible to `["media-coordinator", "admin"]`

**src/components/BottomNav.tsx** (Mobile)

- Added 6 new bottom navigation items
- Shown for media-coordinator role

### Route Protection

**src/lib/settings.ts**

- Added 6 new routes to `routeAccessMap`
- All allow `["media-coordinator", "admin"]`

### Server Components

**src/components/ui/infrastructure-highlights-server.tsx**

```typescript
// Server Component - Fetches data from database
export async function InfrastructureHighlightsServer() {
	// Fetches Facility, AdditionalFeature, CampusStat
	// Transforms data and passes to client component
	return <InfrastructureHighlightsClient {...props} />;
}
```

**src/components/ui/awards-achievements-server.tsx**

```typescript
// Server Component - Fetches data from database
export async function AwardsAchievementsServer() {
	// Fetches Award, AchievementMetric, StudentAchievement
	// Transforms data and passes to client component
	return <AwardsAchievementsClient {...props} />;
}
```

### Client Components

**src/components/ui/infrastructure-highlights.tsx**

- Converted to accept props from server component
- Added TypeScript interfaces for all data types
- Icon mapping: Maps string icon names to lucide-react components
- **Exports**:
  - `InfrastructureHighlightsClient` - Main component accepting props
  - `InfrastructureHighlights` - Backward compatibility with default data

**src/components/ui/awards-achievements.tsx**

- Converted to accept props from server component
- Added TypeScript interfaces for all data types
- Icon mapping: Maps string icon names to lucide-react components
- **Exports**:
  - `AwardsAchievementsClient` - Main component accepting props
  - `AwardsAchievements` - Backward compatibility with default data

### About Page Integration

**src/app/(public)/about/page.tsx**

```typescript
// Updated imports
import { InfrastructureHighlightsServer } from "@/components/ui/infrastructure-highlights-server";
import { AwardsAchievementsServer } from "@/components/ui/awards-achievements-server";

// Wrapped in Suspense
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading infrastructure...</div>}>
  <InfrastructureHighlightsServer />
</Suspense>
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading awards...</div>}>
  <AwardsAchievementsServer />
</Suspense>
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Pattern

### Container/Presenter Pattern

1. **Server Components** (`*-server.tsx`)

   - Fetch data from Prisma database
   - Transform data as needed
   - Pass to client components as props

2. **Client Components** (`*.tsx` with `"use client"`)
   - Accept data as props
   - Handle interactivity (animations, hover effects)
   - Include backward compatibility exports with default data

### Data Flow

```
Database (Prisma)
    ‚Üì
Server Component (*-server.tsx)
    ‚Üì
Client Component (*Client export)
    ‚Üì
Rendered UI
```

### Icon Mapping System

Both components use icon mapping to convert string icon names to React components:

```typescript
const iconMap = {
	Monitor,
	Microscope,
	Calculator,
	BookOpen,
	Trophy,
	Bus, // etc.
};

// Usage
const facilities = facilitiesData.map((f) => ({
	...f,
	icon: iconMap[f.icon] || Monitor, // Fallback to Monitor
}));
```

- **Database**: All actions use Prisma transactions where needed

## üìä Database Schema Details

All models include standard fields:

- `id`: Unique identifier (auto-increment)
- `displayOrder`: For custom sorting
- `isActive`: To show/hide without deleting
- `createdAt`: Timestamp
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp

### Special Field Handling

**Facility.features**: Stored as `Json` type in database

- Form input: Comma-separated string
- Server action: Parses string to array before saving
- Client display: Maps array to list items

**Icon fields**: String type

- Stores icon name (e.g., "Monitor", "Trophy", "Medal")
- Client component maps to actual React component

**Color fields**: String type

- Stores Tailwind gradient classes
- Example: "from-primary to-accent"

## üöÄ Testing Checklist

### Management Pages

- [ ] Visit all 6 management pages as media-coordinator
- [ ] Test create functionality for each model
- [ ] Test update functionality for each model
- [ ] Test delete functionality for each model
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test pagination
- [ ] Test display order changes
- [ ] Test isActive toggle

### Public About Page

- [ ] Visit `/about` page
- [ ] Verify Infrastructure Highlights section displays database content
- [ ] Verify Awards & Achievements section displays database content
- [ ] Test that changes in management pages reflect on About page
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Test animations and hover effects

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Test with empty database (should show default/backward compatible data)
- [ ] Test with only inactive items (sections should be empty or show defaults)
- [ ] Test with very long text in descriptions
- [ ] Test with special characters in text fields
- [ ] Test icon names that don't exist in iconMap (should use fallback)

## üìà Migration Path

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Run the migration
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed initial data (optional)
# You can create a seed file or manually add via management pages
```

### Adding Initial Data

Use the management pages to add:

1. **Facilities**: Main campus buildings (Science Lab, Library, Computer Lab, etc.)
2. **Additional Features**: Campus amenities (Transport, WiFi, Security, etc.)
3. **Campus Stats**: Key numbers (Acres, Classrooms, Students, Teachers)
4. **Awards**: School recognitions with years and categories
5. **Achievement Metrics**: Success rates and counts
6. **Student Achievements**: Competition results and winners

## üéØ Best Practices

### Content Management

1. **Display Order**: Use gaps (10, 20, 30) to allow easy reordering
2. **Icons**: Use consistent icon naming from lucide-react library
3. **Colors**: Use predefined Tailwind gradient combinations for consistency
4. **Images**: Upload to Cloudinary with "school" upload preset
5. **Features**: Keep feature lists concise (3-5 items per facility)

### Database Operations

1. Always check `isActive` status when fetching for public display
2. Order by `displayOrder` for consistent ordering
3. Include `createdAt` DESC as secondary sort
4. Use Prisma transactions for complex operations

### Form Validation

1. All text fields have max length validation
2. Required fields are clearly marked
3. Number fields have min/max constraints
4. Email fields have format validation
5. Icon names should match available icons

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- [ ] Add image galleries for facilities
- [ ] Add award certificate uploads
- [ ] Add student testimonials to achievements
- [ ] Add timeline view for awards
- [ ] Add search/filter on public About page
- [ ] Add export functionality for awards/achievements
- [ ] Add bulk upload for achievements
- [ ] Add rich text editor for descriptions
- [ ] Add tags/categories for facilities
- [ ] Add location/floor information for facilities

## üìù Maintenance Notes

### Regular Tasks

- Review and update campus statistics annually
- Add new awards as received
- Update student achievements after competitions
- Archive old facilities when renovated/removed
- Keep display order optimized

### Common Operations

**Adding a new facility**:

1. Navigate to `/media-coordinator/facilities`
2. Click "Create" button
3. Fill form with title, description, features (comma-separated), icon name, color, image
4. Set display order and active status
5. Save and verify on About page

**Updating achievement metrics**:

1. Navigate to `/media-coordinator/achievement-metrics`
2. Click pencil icon on existing metric
3. Update values
4. Save and verify on About page

## üéì Complete About Page Status

The About page now has **6 out of 7 sections** fully dynamic:

1. ‚úÖ School History (database-driven)
2. ‚úÖ Principal Message (database-driven)
3. ‚ùå Vision & Mission (still hardcoded - architectural decision)
4. ‚úÖ Leadership Team (database-driven)
5. ‚úÖ Staff Directory (database-driven)
6. ‚úÖ Infrastructure Highlights (database-driven) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **NEW**
7. ‚úÖ Awards & Achievements (database-driven) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **NEW**

## üéâ Success Criteria

‚úÖ All 6 database models created and migrated  
‚úÖ All 18 server actions implemented with role checks  
‚úÖ All 6 forms created with validation  
‚úÖ All 6 management pages with CRUD functionality  
‚úÖ FormModal and FormContainer fully integrated  
‚úÖ Menu and BottomNav updated with new links  
‚úÖ Route protection configured  
‚úÖ Server components fetching from database  
‚úÖ Client components converted to accept props  
‚úÖ About page using server components with Suspense  
‚úÖ Icon mapping system working  
‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained  
‚úÖ Zero TypeScript errors

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Features Array**: In FacilityForm, features are input as comma-separated string. The server action parses this to an array before saving to database.

2. **Icon Names**: Must match available icons in lucide-react. Common icons mapped in client components: Monitor, Microscope, Calculator, BookOpen, Trophy, Bus, Wifi, Camera, Shield, Zap, Award, Medal, Star.

3. **Cloudinary Upload**: Images use "school" upload preset. Configure in Cloudinary dashboard if not already set up.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Both client components export default functions that use minimal hardcoded data, ensuring the page works even if database is empty.

5. **Suspense Boundaries**: Each section wrapped in Suspense with loading fallback for better UX during data fetching.
