## 🎯 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Flow:**

```
Admin/Teacher performs action (create exam/assignment/etc.)
    ↓
Action completes successfully in database
    ↓
Automatic trigger function called
    ↓
System checks notification category settings
    ↓
For each target user:
    ↓
    Check user's notification preferences
    ↓
    Check quiet hours (if web push)
    ↓
    Send Email (if enabled)
    ↓
    Send Web Push (if enabled & subscribed)
    ↓
Done! ✅
```

### **User Control:**

- ✅ Users can enable/disable each notification category

## 📝 **NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL)**

If you want to implement the remaining 23 notifications:

1. **Setup Cron Jobs** for scheduled reminders:

   ```bash
   # Create vercel.json
   {
     "crons": [
       {
         "path": "/api/cron/daily-reminders",
         "schedule": "0 8 * * *"
       },
       {
         "path": "/api/cron/weekly-digest",
         "schedule": "0 20 * * 0"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Create cron API routes**:

   - `/api/cron/daily-reminders/route.ts`
   - `/api/cron/weekly-digest/route.ts`

3. **Develop missing features**:
   - Manual assignment grading
   - Late arrival tracking
