## Data Flow

### Admin Transactions:

1. **Data Sources:**

   - `Payment` model (approved only)
   - `Income` model
   - `Expense` model
   - `Salary` model (paid status only)

2. **Transformation:**

   - All transactions unified into single array
   - Sorted by date (descending)
   - Filtered by user selections
   - Paginated

3. **Calculations:**
   - Total Income = Sum of Payments + Income
   - Total Expense = Sum of Expenses + Salaries
   - Balance = Total Income - Total Expense

### Parent Transactions:

1. **Data Sources:**

   - `Payment` model (all statuses)
   - Filtered by parent's student IDs

2. **Display:**
   - Card-based layout with full payment details
   - Approval status clearly shown
   - Screenshot access for online payments

---

## UI/UX Highlights

### Color Coding:

- **Income/Profit**: Green (#10b981)
- **Expense/Loss**: Red (#ef4444)
- **Pending**: Yellow (#f59e0b)
- **Info**: Blue (#3b82f6)

### Responsive Design:

- Mobile-first approach
- Tables hide less important columns on small screens
- Filters stack vertically on mobile
- Cards adapt to screen size

### Icons:

- üíµ CASH
- üí≥ CARD
- üè¶ BANK_TRANSFER
- üì± ONLINE_UPI
- üìù CHEQUE
- üí∞ OTHER

## Database Queries

### Admin Page:

```typescript
// Parallel queries for performance
Promise.all([
  prisma.payment.findMany({ where: { approvalStatus: "APPROVED" }, ... }),
  prisma.income.findMany({ ... }),
  prisma.expense.findMany({ ... }),
  prisma.salary.findMany({ where: { status: "PAID" }, ... })
])
```

### Parent Page:

```typescript
// Single query with filters
prisma.payment.findMany({
	where: {
		studentFee: { studentId: { in: studentIds } },
		// + status, year filters
	},
	include: {
		studentFee: {
			include: { student: true, feeStructure: true },
		},
	},
});
```

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Pagination**: Limits data sent to client (20/15 items per page)
2. **Parallel Queries**: Admin page uses `Promise.all()` for efficiency
3. **Client-Side Filtering**: Filters use client components to avoid full page reloads
4. **Indexed Fields**: Database indexes on date, status, and foreign keys

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Export Functionality**: Add CSV/PDF export for transactions
2. **Date Range Picker**: More granular date filtering
3. **Charts/Graphs**: Visual representation of transaction trends
4. **Bulk Actions**: Mark multiple payments, generate reports
5. **Email Receipts**: Auto-send receipts to parents
6. **Push Notifications**: Notify parents of payment status changes
