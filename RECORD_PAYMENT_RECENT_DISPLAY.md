## Features

### 1. Real-time Updates

- Payments appear immediately after recording
- Page auto-refreshes after successful payment
- Toast notification confirms success

### 2. Today's Payment Counter

- Shows count of payments made today
- Updates automatically
- Displayed in header next to page title

### 3. Empty State

When no payments exist:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│   No payments recorded yet       │
│   Payments will appear here      │
│   after you record them          │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. Responsive Design

- **Mobile**: Shows receipt, student, amount, status
- **Tablet**: Adds fee structure and status
- **Desktop**: Shows all columns including method and date

### 5. Recent Payments Limit

- Displays last **20 payments**
- Ordered by newest first (createdAt DESC)
- Prevents page overload with too much data

## Technical Implementation

### Database Query

```typescript
const recentPayments = await prisma.payment.findMany({
	include: {
		studentFee: {
			include: {
				student: true,
				feeStructure: true,
			},
		},
	},
	orderBy: {
		createdAt: "desc",
	},
	take: 20,
});
```

### Type Safety

```typescript
type PaymentWithRelations = Payment & {
	studentFee: StudentFee & {
		student: Student;
		feeStructure: FeeStructure;
	};
};
```

### Responsive Table Columns

```typescript
const columns = [
	{ header: "Receipt", accessor: "receipt" },
	{ header: "Student", accessor: "student" },
	{
		header: "Fee Structure",
		accessor: "fee",
		className: "hidden md:table-cell",
	},
	{ header: "Amount", accessor: "amount" },
	{
		header: "Payment Method",
		accessor: "method",
		className: "hidden lg:table-cell",
	},
	{ header: "Date", accessor: "date", className: "hidden lg:table-cell" },
	{ header: "Status", accessor: "status", className: "hidden md:table-cell" },
];
```
